			<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the official website about me, my characters, and
				other funny things I have in store.

			<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I am Hamburger317/Luc√≠a! I primarily use Discord,
				so if you have anything you want to say, your best bet is my
				<a href="#discord-link">Discord server</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>What I Am</h3>
			<p>
				I'm Mexican, Salvadoran, but 100% American (as in 100% from the
				Americas, and 100% from the United States of America). I'm also
				from the land of the heathen (California). I am also a...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Programmer</li>
				<li>Artist</li>
				<li>
					and maybe even a
					<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hamburger317Gaming/"
						>gamer</a
					>!
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Other Bits of My Identity</h3>
			<p>
				As a American whose roots come from Latino America, I speak
				English but I am trying to use Spanish more as a primary
				language. I am also a devout Catholic, but like many of other
				aspects of my existence, I tend to question the religion often.
				I am also a <span class="bisexual">bisexual</span> person who
				supports the <span class="rainbow">LGBTQ+</span> with open arms.
				Speaking of the <span class="rainbow">LGBTQ+</span> community, I
				am questioning my gender heavily at the moment. At the moment I
				am using <em>She/Her</em> pronouns at
				the moment.

				<q class="bisexual">
					I'll be the first to admit it. Men are hot.
				</q>

			<h2>All About Starlings</h2>
			<p>
				Starlings are my favorite thing I've made, and I love telling
				stories about them!
			</p>

			<h3>What Exactly Are Starlings?</h3>
			<p>
				Starlings are Celestial creatures coming from outer space! They
				also have many friends like Heartlings, Notelings, and
				Astrodinos (very creative naming). They have a long story I am
				very proud to work on with my good friends every day, one day I
				wish to write a book featuring them.
			</p>

			<h3>Starling 101</h3>
			<p>
				Starlings come in many shapes and sizes, some
				<span class="rainbow">gay</span>, some French, some American,
				and yadadada you get the point. Many Starlings live just like
				us, working like us, eating like us, and having fun like us!
				They make very good pets.
			</p>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>
				Starlings are designed in a simple way that is a pain to draw.
				Most Starlings are drawn featuring a 5 pointed star design with
				curved and very round (somewhat fat) edges that appear more as a
				ink splat than an actual star. Their eyes have slits for eyes
				and a small curvy smile or frown.
			</p>

				Follow me on Social Media! Maybe we can become good friends, I
				think.
